Hello: I downloaded MeshLab today, and I am very impressed. I have a project that I am working on, that involves 3-D scans.
They are of 6 of 6 chesspieces. The scans were imported onto RhinoV5, and altered. I used Netfabb to clean up
errors in three of the files, before printing them. They printed beautifully. I have a Formlabs Form2 printer. 
On the three files that would not print, the model slices in Preform (the software drive program for the Form2 printer) 
show gaps in the slices, which means they will not print, even after the external structure of the files was repaired
(non-manifold edges, and holes being filled, etc.). My Questions are 1. Does MeshLab have a 'FIX ALL' function,
like Netfabb does? The list of functions in MeshLab is almost overwhelming. 2. Does MeshLab have a function that will
ensure that internal structure/layer slices are SOLID, all the way through the model? I am relatively new to 3-D printing, 
and I want to get this project completed. Thank you in advance for you assistance. Karl S.
